# CircularArray

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sveredyuk/ruby-circular-array.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sveredyuk/ruby-circular-array)

You have a week with days and you want to iterate over the week and never met `nil`, but:
```ruby
week = [:mon, :tue, :wed, :thu, :fri, :sat, :sun]
week[0] # => :mon
week[3] # => :thu
week[6] # => :sun
week[7] # => nil... stop what?! I need monday!
```

But it's possible with `CircularArray`
```ruby
require 'circular_array'

circular_week = CircularArray[:mon, :tue, :wed, :thu, :fri, :sat, :sun]

# It behaves like Array. Basically it inherits Array:
circular_week.kind_of? Array # => true

# But it is endless:
circular_week[0] # => :mon
circular_week[3] # => :thu
circular_week[6] # => :sun
circular_week[7] # => :mon
circular_week[8] # => :tue
circular_week[9] # => :wed
circular_week[10] # => :thu
circular_week[11] # => :fri
circular_week[12] # => :sat
circular_week[13] # => :sun
circular_week[14] # => :mon
# great!
```

**You can use it for recursive matching, but do not forget to add anti-infinity loop clause**

Only for empty collection in returns `nil`
```ruby
empty_circular_array = CircularArray.new([])
empty_circular_array[1] # => nil
```

## Use cases

1. Round-robin selection algorithm
2. Matching over a list of possible solutions
3. Cycling dates for complex delivery logic

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
